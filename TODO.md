## Low-level Systems Programming:

	* Memory Manager: Write a program that simulates a memory manager using C/C++. The program should be able to allocate and deallocate memory dynamically and keep track of the memory usage. The program should use a memory allocation algorithm such as first fit, best fit, or worst fit and should be able to handle fragmentation.
	* Assembly Language Calculator: Write a simple calculator program using assembly language. The program should be able to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The program should take input from the user and display the result on the screen.
	* Shell: Write a simple shell program in C/C++ that can execute basic commands such as ls, cd, and echo. The shell should be able to run commands in the background, redirect input and output, and handle command-line arguments.
	* File system: Write a program that simulates a basic file system using C/C++. The program should be able to create, delete, and list files and directories. The file system should use a simple file allocation algorithm such as contiguous or indexed allocation.
	* System calls: Write a program that makes use of system calls such as fork, exec, and wait to create and manage processes in C/C++. The program should be able to create child processes, wait for their completion and return the exit status.

## Robotics and AI:

	* Self-driving car simulation: Simulate a self-driving car using a robotics framework such as ROS and implement basic control systems and sensor data processing algorithms. Use a sensor such as LIDAR or camera to detect obstacles and use a control algorithm such as PID to follow a path.
	* Image recognition: Train a neural network to recognize objects in images using a machine learning framework such as TensorFlow. Use a dataset of images with labels and train a convolutional neural network to classify the images.
	* Voice recognition: Implement a program that can recognize speech and respond to voice commands using a speech recognition library such as CMU Sphinx. Use a dataset of audio samples with transcripts to train the speech recognition model.
	* Robotics arm control: Control a robotic arm using a microcontroller and implement basic control systems to move the arm to specific positions. Use sensors such as encoders or potentiometers to measure the position of the arm and use a control algorithm such as inverse kinematics to move the arm to a target position.

## Web Development:

	* Simple website: Create a simple website using HTML, CSS and JavaScript that displays a personal portfolio or resume. The website should have a navigation menu, and several sections such as an "About me" section, a "Projects" section, and a "Contact" section.
	* To-do list: Create a web-based to-do list application using a web development framework such as React or Angular. The application should be able to add, edit, and delete tasks, and should be able to save the tasks to the browser's local storage.
	* Chat application: Create a web-based chat application using web sockets and a web development framework such as Node.js. The chat application should be able to send and receive messages in real-time and should be able to handle multiple users.
	* E-commerce website: Create a simple e-commerce website using a web development framework such as Ruby on Rails. The website should be able to display products, handle shopping cart, and handle orders and payments.
